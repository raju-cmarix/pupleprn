Patients see the benefit of more individual attention and care.</p>

                            <p>In allied health, opportunities for financial advancement are scarce.  Most therapists are underpaid, especially those with advanced training, certifications, and specialties.  We think clinicians should have the option to set their price and this will enable the market to pay a premium to therapists who have dedicated themselves to improving their education and skills. Our minimal fees allow clinicians and clinics to keep more of their hard-earned money.</p>
